# Elrond Balance Address Generator

Find cool bech32 Elrond addresses with custom filters.

Uses the untouched elrond open source keygen code, but discards addresses not matching the filter.

Original keygenerator: https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/tree/master/cmd/keygenerator

To compile erd1keygen, golang has to be installed on your machine.

Run the script for your platform:

Build on Linux: run build_linux.sh (run chmod a+x on it or run with 'bash' in front)

Build on Windows: run build_windows.bat

Read README found next to the binary or next to main.go on this repository for instructions on how to operate the keygenerator.

Have fun!

With some luck you might find a gem like this:
